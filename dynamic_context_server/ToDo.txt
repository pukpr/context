general work
W	Collect all XLS and PPT files
	generate a simpler unit scale function
	Index the papers for PDF
x	Acronyms, add via Zotero
	Unit tests
	switch graphs to native format whenever possible
	Use target=_parent or target=_top
	hover on various links
	Dimensions need more granular ranges, not micron with meters
	Finish up the locales for models


if time available
x	Periodic table in triple store format
	Sometimes graph needs more sig figs
	Semi-Markov sync function to scale
	Store FFT model as triples
	Named notation for graph
	Put CSIR data as an extra tuple
	Simulated data for DEM application
	Name for temporary R files
	DEM meta data
	Land,Terrain,Aquatic terms
	Particulate model in salt/fresh water
	Add average elevation to DEM
