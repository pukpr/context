It defines the climatic conditions
materiel may be exposed to and gives guidance in the selection of appropriate
test levels for some test procedures. It does not define test procedures,
because there may be valid reasons for performing tests under conditions that
are not entirely realistic. Four climatic design types, differentiated by
temperature characteristics, are in 
</a><a href="#ch2">
chapter 2
</a>
. These design types give guidance
in preparing requirements documents and other documents covering RDTE and
procurement of Army materiel. A map showing locations of the four types of
design criteria is included (

).

<font color="#006400"><i></i></font>
This regulation is concerned primarily
with the mechanical operation or functioning of materiel under the extremes
of climate to which it is likely to be exposed. It is recognized that some
environmental elements or conditions (smoke, haze, fog, shimmer, and clouds,
for example) may affect the ability of some materiel, particularly Electro
optical equipment, to perform its mission. Unfortunately, the effects of these
environmental factors on the operation of electro-optical devices cannot be
reliably quantified at this time. Therefore, design criteria for visibility
requirements are not given in this regulation.
</p></a>
<a name="s11-2f"><p class="indent1"><i>f.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i></i></font>
Although climate is the most important
element of the total natural environment as far as military equipment design
is concerned, other environmental elements such as vegetation, soils, landforms,
and biological agents also affect the performance of materiel. In some cases,
these factors may be more responsible for deterioration and failure than climate.
No attempt is made to specify criteria for these non-climatic elements in
this regulation. It is recommended that, wherever appropriate, they be stated
in requirement documents.

									<i>
Operational conditions.
</i>
These
are climatic conditions in the open to which materiel might be subjected during
operations or standby for operations. Ambient temperature and humidity conditions
are those measured under standard conditions of ventilation and radiation
shielding in a meteorological shelter at a height of 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8
meters) above the ground and determined according to the risk policy in 
</a><a href="#s11-5b">
paragraph
1-5
<i>
b
</i>
</a>
. Solar radiation, which might be experienced concurrently with
the temperature and humidity, is also stated for many of the climatic conditions.
Although the standard conditions measured in meteorological shelters are usually
not exactly the same as the operational environment for materiel, it is necessary
to state operational conditions in standard terms so
&#8212;
</p>

<a name="s31-3c(1)(a)">

<i>
										(a)

Measurements have the same meaning in all parts

</a>
<a name="s31-3c(1)(b)">
<p class="indent3">
<i>
										(b)
										
</i>
The great range of variations in
response of different materiel to a given climatic condition is not a complicating
factor in setting design criteria. 


<br>
<br>
For example, the temperature of the materiel
itself may vary considerably from the operational air temperature because
of the effects of incoming solar radiation, internal sources of heat, the
thermal mass, and the heat transfer characteristics of the materials. Most
items exposed to the sun will attain higher temperatures than the air temperature.
The exact temperature can be obtained through actual or simulated exposure
to the appropriate daily cycle, or through the development and use of suitable
mathematical models.
</p>
</a>
<a name="s21-3c(2)">
<p class="indent2">

									(2)

									<i>
Storage and transit conditions.
</i>
These are temperature and humidity conditions materiel might be subjected
to in storage and transit situations. Examples of these situations are
&#8212;
</p>
</a>
<a name="s31-3c(2)(a)">
<p class="indent3">
<i>
										(a)

Inside an unventilated field storage shelter.

</a>
<a name="s31-3c(2)(b)">
<p class="indent3">
<i>
										(b)
										
</i>
In a railway boxcar. 
<br>
<br>



Because of great differences in temperature and humidity in varying storage modes, the severity
of the exposure depends upon the choice of storage mode as much as the storage
location. This is very important in areas of extreme solar radiation and high
humilities. Storage and transit air temperature and humidity may differ from
operational temperature and humidity because of the induced effects of heat
gains or losses of air in confined spaces. Where a large thermal mass is involved
(e.g., in food storage), the temperature of the stores may be much lower than
the storage air temperature stated, and may have little daily variation. Temperature
for such a thermal mass is derived by using data from previous similar storage
conditions or is determined by actual measurement under current conditions.

Areas of potential use for Army materiel include
all parts of the world except the Antarctic continent. Standard general-purpose
materiel will be designed for safe and effective use under the specified conditions
of the basic climatic design type (defined in 
</a><a href="#ch2">
chap. 2
</a>
). Materiel for use under
the conditions of extreme climatic design types (hot, cold, and severe cold)
will be provided by designing

<p class="indent2">

									(3)

									<i>

</i>
Modification kits which adapt new standard materiel or previously type-classified
standard materiel. 
<br>
<br>



The approach chosen will be that which gives satisfactory
results most economically, considering the extent of deployment in each area
of potential use, the current technology level, and the time required for
development. For example, if certain materiel is to be used only in areas
where cold conditions prevail, materiel should be designed solely for the
conditions of those areas.
</p>
</a>
<a name="s11-5b"></a><p class="indent1"><a name="s11-5b"><i>b.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i></i></font>
Climatic requirements as well as
performance standards for operations, storage, and transit will be stated
in requirement documents. Because climatic requirements can have a substantial
impact on acquisition and support costs, materiel will be designed, developed,
and tested to operate under conditions less severe than the absolute extremes
that may occur within the areas of intended use. This implies there is some
risk of failure to operate at times. (See 
</a><a href="#appa">
app A
</a>
 for discussion of risk levels.)
The four climatic design types outlined in chapter 2 all contain some element
of risk. Also because of cost considerations, it is general policy to accept
reduced performance under the hot, cold, and severe cold conditions as compared
to performance under the basic conditions.
</p>
<a name="s11-5c"><p class="indent1"><i>c.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i></i></font>
Army materiel will be designed to
be compatible with user personnel fully clothed and equipped for protection
against conditions of potential use.

<a name="s11-5d"><p class="indent1"><i>d.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i></i></font>
Testing in climatic chambers will
be fully and creatively exploited before testing in the natural environment.
Test results from climatic chambers, however, cannot be interpreted as a total
substitute for tests conducted in natural environments.
</p></a>
<a name="s11-5e"><p class="indent1"><i>e.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i></i></font>
Sites for field testing will be selected,
if possible, to induce representative deterioration rates and performance
challenges from all environmental effects that the newly developed materiel
will be expected to encounter under tactical operational conditions. When
time and fund constraints permit sites with the highest materiel deterioration
rates or most severe conditions may be selected.

<a name="s11-5f"><p class="indent1"><i>f.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i></i></font>
DA will support research to develop
information about the areal and temporal distribution of climatic and terrain
conditions that influence RDTE of materiel.
</p></a>
<a name="s11-5g"><p class="indent1"><i>g.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i></i></font>
The interaction of equipment with
the environment should be considered in all phases of RDTE because the induced
conditions may be quite different from those of the natural environment. Sheltered
materiel must be designed to operate under the conditions within the shelter
during operation in the stipulated areas.

in those climates. An item developed for the basic climatic design type may
fail in the more severe climatic conditions of the hot, cold, or severe cold
types, and in some cases produce catastrophic or extremely hazardous results.

							Application of design values.

</a>
<p>
The general design values in 
<a href="#ch2">
chapter 2
</a>
 represent a conservative
design approach; that is, there is little risk that the design values will
be exceeded in the areas to which they apply. Because there is some risk,
the design values should be modified for some materiel items. In certain cases,
failure of an item may be so critical that more severe climatic criteria should
be applied to ensure against environment-related failure. In other cases,
the consequences of failure may be slight, so that the cost of designing to
the given values may be unwarranted. Special study may be required in these
cases to determine the most appropriate design values (
<a href="#s21-6c%283%29">

<i>
c
</i>

</a>
). The
type of failure is also an important consideration. Two categories of failure
that may cause different design decisions are identified as follows:
</p>
<a name="s11-8a"><p class="indent1"><i>a.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i>Reversible failure.</i></font>
For the duration
of climatic extremes, the materiel may continue to function, but its performance

Simulated climatic tests.
</i>
The
use of simulated climatic tests is encouraged, especially under combined (e.g.,
temperature and humidity) and sequential conditions, that supports efforts
aimed at better simulation through improved test procedures and facilities.
In certain cases, it will not be practical or necessary to duplicate exact
conditions of the applicable climatic design values in these tests. The materiel,
however, will be tested to meet the guidelines of the requirements document.
Developers doing simulated climatic tests will use the daily cycles normally
found in nature as their models, rather than chamber testing only at the extreme
condition. This daily cycling gives more realistic moisture 5 AR 70-38
 15 September 1979 condensation and temperature response patterns. Test planners
and environmental specialists will consult with each other on how the climatic
design values apply to testing. (See para, 1-6

									<i>
Accelerated and aggravated tests.
</i>
Accelerated tests approximate conditions, which may occur in nature, but with
a greater frequency or duration than would be expected naturally. Aggravated
tests involve subject materiel to more extreme conditions than are found in
nature. The results of accelerated and aggravated tests are evaluated in terms
of what they imply for future service performance. Specifically, they give
rapid feedback on problems requiring corrective action as well as statistical
data on the margin of safety provided by the design. Comparing results of
these tests with results of field climatic tests of service performance will
give a better interpretation of results. It also increases confidence in the
use of such techniques in subsequent similar situations. In chamber tests,
developers are cautioned that subjecting materiel to more extreme conditions
than are found in nature may introduce problems that will not occur when testing
is conducted in the natural environment. (An example is the liquification
of TNT, which does not occur at temperatures below 150°For 66°C.)
This is overtesting. On the other hand, the successful conclusion of chamber
tests does not guarantee than an item of equipment will operate satisfactorily
in the natural environment, because nature involves complex, synergistic effects
that cannot presently be induced in chambers (para 2-9). Such factors
must be considered by the developer when evaluating results obtained in chambers.
Test planners and environmental specialists will consult with each other to
determine the extreme combinations of conditions that occur in nature. (See

</a><a href="#s21-6c%283%29">

<a name="s11-9b"></a><p class="indent1"><a name="s11-9b"><i>b.</i>

Although climatic conditions during a field day test are not likely to be
as extreme as the values specified in 
</a><a href="#ch2">
chapter 2
</a>
, there are distinct advantages
to conducting tests in a real world environment where the combined effects
of several climatic factors can cause difficulties not revealed by chamber
testing. (See para 
<a href="#p02-8">
2-8
</a>
 and 
<a href="#p02-9">
2-9
</a>
.) On the other hand, when tests are
conducted under less than the specified extreme conditions, the adequacy of
the natural tests must be reviewed particularly when test results are marginal.
Consideration should then be given to results obtained under simulated extreme
conditions. Data describing climatic conditions prevailing during field tests
at the test site will be recorded to provide a basis for future evaluation.

Basic high humidity
conditions are found most often in tropical areas, although they occur briefly
or seasonally in the midlatitudes. One of the two high humidity cycles (constant
high humidity) represents conditions in the heavily forested areas where nearly
constant conditions may prevail during rainy and wet seasons. The other daily
cycle (variable high humidity) represents conditions found in the open in
tropical areas. In the first cycle, exposed materiel is likely to be constantly
wet or damp for many days at a time. In the second cycle, exposed items are
subject to alternate wetting and drying. Both conditions promote severe deterioration
in materiel. The one that is most important, as shown below, 

depends on the nature of the equipment involved.

0.5 percent of the hours in the rainiest month. For certain classes of materiel
(e.g., missiles, aircraft) that might be subject to erosion from the more

Blowing snow.
</i>
Operational extremes
for blowing snow are given in terms of horizontal mass flux of snow particles;
that is, the mass of snow moving horizontally across a unit area per unit
time. Mass flux decreases significantly with increasing height; highest fluxes
are found below 2 inches (0.05 m). Therefore, extremes of blowing snow are
given for height intervals up to 33 feet (10 m). Design values should be based
on the height of the equipment. The horizontal mass windspeed of 44 fps (13
mps) at a height above fluxes for operational extremes, with a ground or snow
surface of 10 feet (3 m), as shown in 
</a><a href="#fig2_9">
Figure 2-9
</a>
. When blown by strong
winds, snow crystals are broken and abraded into roughly equal size grains
with rounded or subangular corners. More particles occur in the size range
of 0.02 min to 0.4 mm, where the size is the effective diameter as shown in

<a href="#fig2_10">
Figure 2-10
</a>
, in the plane of measurement. Smaller sizes tend to occur
at lower temperatures. Within the basic cold regions, the typical temperature
range during periods of blowing snow is 14°F to -4°F (-10°C to
-20°C). Within the cold and severe cold regions, snowfall is common at
temperatures between -10°F and -20°F (-23°C to -29°C). Blowing
snow may occur at temperatures as low as -40°F (-40°C).

Icing phenomena
include glaze (freezing rain), hoarfrost, and rime, which cause problems of
ice accretion on aircraft and other materiel, and ice fog, which interferes
with visibility. Although reliable and systematic data on ice accumulation
are scarce, fairly large areas of the United States and Europe can expect
to endure seven or more ice storms per year. The effects of the storms may
last from a few hours to several days. In the same areas, probably one storm
per year on the average is severe enough to cause some damage. In perhaps
one year out of two or three, ice accumulation will probably be a half-inch
or more. Therefore, if all-weather operation of materiel is desired within
the areas where icing may occur the operational design value should be for
one-half inch of glaze with specific gravity of 0.9. This includes the colder
sections within the basic design type, and all of the cold and severe cold
areas. If equipment failure during the time of icing can be tolerated, the
question of withstanding more severe storms without permanent damage becomes
important. For withstanding, the values as given in MIL-STD-210B
are as follows:

Ice fog consists of suspended ice crystals averaging 5 to 20 micrometers in
diameter. In areas where sufficient water vapor is present, ice fog occurs
mainly at temperatures below -20°F (-37°C), ice fog may be very dense,
limiting visibility of a few feet. Ice fog is often locally induced by the
operation of motor vehicles, power plants, weapon systems. It is usually high
in concentration of contaminants from the burning of hydrocarbon fuels and
explosive fuels. It affects the performance of electro-optical systems because
of its attenuation and degradation of electromagnetic radiation in the atmosphere.

consider the possibility of encountering hailstones up to 2 inches (51 mm)

<font color="#006400"><i>Wind.</i></font>
Wind is probably the most
complex of all climatic elements affecting materiel. Wind effects are difficult
to analyze because wind is a vector quantity subject to rapid temporal and
areal changes in speed and direction. In addition to parameters of average
speed and direction, a complete description of wind includes the random motions
of widely different scales and periods called atmospheric turbulence or eddies.
The wind forces on a structure result from differential pressures, positive
and negative, caused by an obstruction to the free flow of the wind. Thus,
these forces are functions of the velocity and turbulence of the wind and
of the orientation, area, and shape of the elements of the structure.

Sand
and dust are usually differentiated on the basis of particle size, although
there are no generally accepted specific size limits for the two kinds of
particles. For most military applications, it is important to distinguish
between the smaller particles (dust) and the larger particles (sand) because
of their different effects on equipment. Dust can penetrate small openings,
cause undue wear to moving parts, and interfere with electrical contacts.
Blowing sand, which may be too large to penetrate the smaller openings, can
erode and abrade the outside of equipment. Sand and dust present in the air
affect the performance of electro-optical systems because of their atenuation
and degradation of electromagnetic radiation in the atmosphere. Particles
vary in diameter from 0.1 to 1,000 micrometers (3.94 × 10

of the prime arguments for conducting field tests, because it is extremely

<a name="s12-11a"><p class="indent1"><i>a.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i>Hot climatic design type.</i></font>
The areas
where hot conditions apply include most of the lowlatitude deserts of the
world. During summer in these areas, temperatures above 110°F (43°C)
occur frequently, but except for a few specific localities, temperatures will
seldom be above 120°F (49°C). In winter, temperatures are not likely
to be extremely low so that the low temperatures of the basic climatic design
type apply. If materiel is designed only for the hot type, a special recommendation
for low temperature design values should be sought. Limited portions of this
area are sometimes subject to very high absolute humilities, although the
highest temperatures and highest dewpoints do not occur at the same time.
</p></a>
<a name="s12-11b"><p class="indent1"><i>b.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i>Basic climatic design type.</i></font>
The area this type applies to includes the most densely populated
and heavily industrialized parts of the world as well as the humid tropics.
The entire range of basic design conditions does not necessarily apply to
any one place. Each single design condition (high temperature, low temperature,
high humidity) applies to a widespread area. When taken together, the design
values should provide for satisfactory equipment throughout the area involved.
Tropical areas are included in the basic climatic design type because the
temperature of the humid tropics is quite moderate, and the humidity is also
experienced in the midlatitudes. The unique feature of the tropics that makes
it important to materiel is the persistence of high humidity over long periods
of time. This condition not only promotes corrosion but is an excellent environment
for insect and microbiological damage.

<font color="#006400"><i>Cold and severe cold design types.</i></font>
The areas designated as cold, and severe cold, primarily northern North America,
Greenland, northern Asia, and the Tibetan Highlands of China, were delimited
because of the occurrence of low temperatures. In the area of the cold design
type, temperature during the coldest month in a normal year may be colder
than the basic cold extreme of -25°F (-32°C). In the severe cold areas,
temperature during the coldest month in a normal year may be colder than the
cold extreme of -50°F (-46°C), but colder than -60°F (-51°C)
no more than 20 percent of the hours in the coldest month in the coldest part
of the area (northern Siberia where absolute minimum temperatures as low as
-90°F (-68°C) have been recorded). Because the extreme low temperatures
are not controlled by a daily solar cycle, they persist for a long enough
period of time for materiel to reach equilibrium at a temperature near the
minimum.

<p>
To provide background for the proper use of this regulation, its
relationship to MIL-STD-210B is outlined. There are two main differences
between the two publications.
</p>
<a name="s1A-1a"><p class="indent1"><i>a.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i></i></font>
MIL-STD-210B applies only to materiel
developed for worldwide use. AR 70-38 gives design values for most Army
materiel, whether intended for worldwide or for more limited use.
</p></a>
<a name="s1A-1b"><p class="indent1"><i>b.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i></i></font>
The treatment of withstanding values.
Both publications reflect a philosophy that accepts a small risk of failure
during periods of extreme weather. They also require a complete return to
operation after exposure to extreme conditions has ended. MIL-STD-210B,
however, considers only the likelihood of natural extremes occurring, whereas
AR 70-38 considers the induced conditions many items are exposed to
during transit and storage. This difference means that Army materiel must
be able to withstand much higher air temperatures than those in MIL-STD-210B,
although the high temperatures for operation are the same.

					Risk policy.
</font>
</b>
</p>
</a>
<p>
</p>
<a name="s1A-2a"><p class="indent1"><i>a.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i></i></font>
In the Ground Environment section, MIL-STD-210B
contains single worldwide values for each climatic element to be considered
in the design of materiel for operations. For most climatic elements, the
design value selected was the value exceeded not more than one percent of
the hours in the most extreme month in an average year at the most severe
location for that element. (For low temperature the level selected was 20
percent of the hours and for rainfall the level selected was 0.5 percent of
the hours.) These values have become known as one percent design values. When
they are applied collectively they are often referred to as a one percent
risk policy. Although this is a convenient short designation, it can be misleading
to those who are not aware of this specific definition of a one percent risk
policy. In fact, there is no way to quantify, with any degree of accuracy,
the probability that materiel will ever encounter a given extreme of an environmental
element. It can be stated with assurance that the designated one percent risk
levels as used in MIL-STD-210B are very conservative. For example,
on a year-round basis, the risk of encountering the design level of a selected
element approaches 1/12 of one percent (there is some likelihood of occurrence
in other than the most extreme month). Also, for many of the climatic elements,
the design value applies only to the most severe location in the world. Therefore,
the risk of materiel encountering this extreme may be very small, particularly
if the value at the most severe location is representative of only a small
area or the location is in a remote part of the world.
</p></a>
<a name="s1A-2b"><p class="indent1"><i>b.</i>
<font color="#006400"><i></i></font>
The above considerations led to the adoption of the system now
used in AR 70-38 It provides alternate design values for items not
intended for worldwide use. Consequently, the world was divided, on the basis
of temperature, into four types. The design temperatures in this four-type
division are somewhat arbitrary. However, the geographic areas encompassed
by the basic design type contain most of the world's population and
landmass. In general, the lines delimiting the areas included in a design
type have the same basis as MIL-STD-210B; that is, one percent
of the hours in the most severe month on average exceeded the design temperature.
Note, however, that it is only along the demarcation line that this criterion
applies exactly. For example, if more than one percent of the hours in the
coldest month at a given location are below -50°F(-46°C), the area
represented by that location is considered part of the cold climatic design
type. Yet, at that location, there may be almost no chance of occurrence of
-60°F (-51°C), which is the lower design value for that type. On the
other hand, there are stations in the areas included in the severe cold design
type that have temperatures below -60°F (-51°C) for as much as 20
percent of the hours in the coldest month. This kind of variation within the
regions could be eliminated only by creating a large number of small regions,
a procedure that would make this regulation unduly complex.
