<p>The knowledge-based system provides semantic web discovery capability through ontology and instance data.  OSCAR is short of Ontological System for Context Artifacts and Resources.  The goal is to provide guide discovery for users to find context models and associated metadata to enable their simulation.  The context models can include collections of PDFs and PSDs.
