<p>Corrosion of metals is a slow process, accelerated by adverse enviornmental factors such as high levels of salt and acidity.

<p>We apply a diffusional model of corrosion which emulates the temporal profile of the empirical observations while providing an intutive understanding to the gradual processes involved.

<p>The empirical parameters were taken from a recent study which considered long term corrosive effects in variously categorized environments.
