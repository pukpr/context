<p>The context knowledgebase contains semantic information which allows it to be be searched in a structured fashion. The set of references to research articles, specifications, and standards is managed by the <a href="http://www.zotero.org/about/">Zotero documentation citation system</a>. Individual citations are tagged with terms from <a href="http://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov">SWEET</a> to indicate the enviromental concepts that apply.</p>

<p>A typical query is shown below for a specfic SWEET term. Regular references are distinguished from specifications (<img width="20" src="/html/images/spec.gif"/>) and model foundational documents (<img width="20" src="/html/images/priority.gif"/>), the latter of which contain detailed information to support the construction of models for the context library.</p>

<table border=1><tr><td><img src="/html/images/references_example.GIF" width="100%"/></td></tr></table>


<p>For non-structured information rerieval, the search bar in the upper-right corner finds information within the knowledgebase that is not semantically orgranized.</p>
