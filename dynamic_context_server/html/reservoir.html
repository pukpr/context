<p>This category links to models of fossil fuel usage and potential impacts on climate change.

<p>The models are useful for making projections but as much of the data can not be verified as controlled experiments, the results are somewhat speculative.

<p>
A detailed description of the fossil fuel resource models are available via the online book <a href="/ref/foundation/TheOilConundrum.pdf">The Oil Conundrum</a> (also at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oY2ZPn5EOTQC">Google Books</a>).

The CSALT model describes the global average temperature anomaly as studied in climate change science.
