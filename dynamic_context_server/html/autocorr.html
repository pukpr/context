Terrain Elevation models marginal probabilities shown on a log scale indicating likelihood of an elevation change given a surface translation.

<p>Terrain is characterized for the lower 48 states according to DEM profiles. The surface translation is limited to 40 post spacings which corresponds to less than 4000 meters and the elevation change is limited to 20 meters.

<p>Fits for each 1 degree section are generated via a Gauss-Markov model following an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) reversion-to-the-mean random walk process. A maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approximator generates uncertainty in the O-U model, which in general gives a better fit to the terrain data sets.
