<h3>Environmental Context Server Features</h3>
The dynamic context server provides interactive content for environmental modeling. The models are contained within an ontolologically organized knowledgebase and so can be semantically accessed. The semantic organization allows various search mechanisms while the modeling domains are roughly grouped according to the icons described below.

A context is defined as the surrounding environment for a specific intended use, such as for evaluating vehicle design or performance.
