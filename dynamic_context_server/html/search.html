<p>Many common environmental models share the same underlying stochastic pattern. In general, this means that we can use similar math to capture the characteristics of behavior across a range of domains even though the measured quantities are not comparable.

<p>The important case for PCC estimates is the probability density function (PDF) of environmental characteristics showing a spread in uncertainty in values.

<p>PDFs and other models can be searched according to feature keywords or SWEET (Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology) categories based on applicability to the context space.
