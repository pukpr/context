<p>Library hiearchy of major environmental classifications, <b>Land, Aquatic, and Atmospheric</b></p>


<p>
<a name="land"/>The <b>Land</b> classification consists of all terrestrial models, specifically those attached to solid earth.  This includes both natural terrain and man-made obstacles, and anything that deals with the terrestrial surface. Natural terrain is largely stochastic, with elements of determinism mixed in via certain man-assisted or physical processes.</p>

<p>
    <a name="terrain"></a>
<b>Terrain</b> is defined by the vertical and horizontal dimension of land surface. Characteristics of the terrain is usually expressed in terms of the elevation, slope, and orientation of terrain features

<p>
        <a name="gross terrain"></a>
The <b>gross terrain</b> is also referred to as topography or land relief. The deterministic view of terrain is typically represented by a scaled elevation contour plot of a specific region of land. The stochastic view is represented by models of the topography, which is often cast in terms of a random walk process.

<p>
            <a name="slopes"></a>
The <b>slope</b> of the terrain is characterized by the empirically measured rise/run of the local surface area. It is also known as the grade or pitch. By orientating perpendicular to the maximum slope, a pitch characterization becomes a roll characterization.

In general, natural terrains show greater variation in slopes than do man-made features, such as roads or rail-road tracks, which will show signs of grading and switchbacks or other grade limitations.

<p>
            <a name="elevations"></a>
A characterization of terrain <b>elevations</b> is usually correlated against a geospatial surface dimension. Analyzing pair correlations between elevations separated by a lateral surface dimension allow models of regional topography to be made.  By using stochastic models of the terrain with well-characterized probability distributions, one can use that as an input or constraining stimulus for navigability and formal verification.

<p>
        <a name="fine terrain"></a>
Characterization of <b>fine terrain</b> requires a scale much less than the topography or land relief of the local region.  To remove this macroscopic effect of large scale elevation and slope changes, data is often detrended to reveal only the fine detail.

<p>
            <a name="roughness"></a>
The fine terrain <b>roughness</b> is characterized by a pair correlation function and the frequency representation known as the power spectral density.  The typical terrain roughness may follow a random enough pattern so that the information contained in a correlation function or PSD is enough to reveal the stochastic nature of the ground.

<p>
            <a name="profile"></a>
Oftentimes the fine terrain <b>profile</b> shows enough regularity that additions of non-randomness to the model becomes effecive.  Fine terrain with elements of randomness can include washboard surface and cobblestone roads. Individual profiles are often referenced for further evaluation and usually referred to as test tracks or courses when used in the context of vehicle evaluation. A stochastic model of the terrain, if it is characterized fully, can reduce the storage data requirements by orders of magnitude, leaving a few parameters to describe a specific course profile.

<p>
    <a name="obstacles"></a>
Discrete <b>obstacles</b> are always characterized by a geometrically defined spatial profile.

<p>
    <a name="soil"></a>
<b>Soil</b> classification schemes simplify the cataloguing of the variety of naturally occurring soils into a handful of types according to a few properties such as granularity.

<hr/> <!------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>
<a name="aquatic"></a>
The <b>aquatic</b> classification consists of all ocean and inland water models, and specifically that dealing with the surface characterization of a particular body of water. This can include wave height, lake sizes, and river current speed.


<p>
    <a name="sea state"></a>
The <b>sea state</b> of a water's surface at a specific location and time qualifies its general conditions by categorizing according to wave height and other related characteristics such as period and power spectrum.  Higher sea-states correspond to rougher conditions, with zero indicating calm waters.
<img src="/html/images/sea_state_geometry.gif" align="right"/>

<p>
        <a name="wave height"></a>
By empirically measuring the historical <b>wave height</b> in a specific location and attaching probabilities to the occurence of various wave heights, we can generate the probability of encountering a particular sea state.

<p>
        <a name="wave frequency"></a>
The <b>wave frequency</b> is closely related to wave height and wave frequency by a dispersion relationship. Because of the common hydrodynamic properties of water, it is often enough to consider only wave heights when inferring the frequency and wavelength of water.


<p>
    <a name="lake size"></a>
<a name="stream current"></a>

The distribution of <b>lake sizes</b> and <b>stream currents</b> has a stochastic explanation, and models of these distributions can fit to empirically collected statistics.


<p>
    <a name="water density"></a>
Characterizing <b>water density</b> allows for the effects of buoyancy to be determined. Both temperature and salinity can subtly effect the density of water.

<hr/> <!------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
<a name="atmospheric"></a>
The category of <b>atmospheric</b> models contains phenomenon that relate insofar as they propagate through the air.

<p>
    <a name="wind speed"></a>
The variation of <b>wind speed</b> in specific geographic locations is very much a stochastic phenonema.  The general trend is of decreasing likelihood of wind speeds with increasing magnitude.

<p>
    <a name="precipitation"></a>
<b>Precipation</b> in the form of rain and snow varies accoring to geographic location and season.  Models of rainfall are available, as are environmental standards which give nominal conditions for certain regions and climates.

<p>
        <a name="rainfall amount"></a>
The statistics of <b>rainfall amount</b> has a foundation in extreme value theory, yet the commonly occuring measured rainfalls follow distribution functions that can be modeled.

<p>
        <a name="cloudiness"></a>
Based on recently accumulated data, the areal extent of <b>clouds</b> has been shown to follow a simple stochastic model.

<p>
    <a name="temperature"></a>
The modeling of atmospheric <b>temperature</b> has a lower spread  in relative uncertainty than other environmental contexts. This has much to do with the large thermal inertia of the planet and of the predicatably of diurnal and seasonal change. Thus, models of temperature are better suited to description by a mean value and small <i>relative</i> (on the Kelvin scale)

<p>
        <a name="solar"></a>
The model of <b>solar</b> insolation is determinstically predicatable, abated only by sporadic cloud cover.

<p>
        <a name="daily and seasonal"></a>
The diurnal or <b>daily and seasonal</b> temperature variations can be captured for specific geospatial locations and modeled over the course of a full year, including a moving average for the 24-hour period.  In terms of nominal conditions, representative regions can be defined as "hot" to "extreme cold" and typical mean values can be generated to cover the expected values.

<p>
        <a name="thermal"></a>
Models of transient response to <b>thermal</b> steady-state require compliance between the system under study and the environment.  In general terms, this means that the system can influence the environment enough to affect the dynamics and the eventual steady-state point (if one exists).


<p>
    <a name="humidity"></a>
The <b>humidity</b> of a particular region is given by nominal conditions. Since humidity only plays a contextual role over a long term, in say promoting corrosion, the nominal values are adequate. Therefor, environmental standards serve as better defining documents than models based on empirical data for a specific location.

<p>
    <a name="particulates"></a>
Airborne <b>particulates</b> can show persistent or transient effects. After significant natural events such as the eruption of volcanos, the density and size of particulates can increase rapidly. Otherwise, a heterogeneous mix of particles from differnt origin describes the typical distribution.
Also suspended water-borne particulates,

<p>
        <a name="particle size"></a>
Airborne particulates show a diversity in <b>particle size</b>. If the particles can grow over time, such as ice crystals, the steady-state distribution in parts reflects where the particle is in it's life cycle.

<p>
        <a name="particle density"></a>
Airborne particulates show ranges id <b>particle density</b> usually depending on the transient event.

<p>
    <a name="EMI"></a>

<p>
        <a name="external EM"></a>
<p>
            <a name="EMI clutter"></a>
Background noise from the environment is reffered to as <b>clutter</b>
<p>
            <a name="RF EM"></a>
Radio and radar transmitters can present very high levels of energy and electromagnetic field strength to a system and the equipment and subsystems it contains.  This type of environment is referred to as the external <b>Radio Frequency (RF) Electromagnetic Environment (EME)</b>.  RF EME is described in terms of field strength as a function of frequency.

<p>
            <a name="EM pulse"></a>
An <b>electromagnetic pulse</b> is a rare occurence of either natural or man-made origin. One variation of this is high power <a name="microwave"></a> high power microwave which can be a single pulse or transmitted as a repetetive waveform.

<p>
            <a name="lightning effects"></a>
<b>Ligntning effects</b> can be either direct or indirect. The direct effects refers to the situation were the lightning channel couples to the system, whereas indirect refers to situations where the lightning is observed only remotely through sound, flashes, vibration, or interference.

<p>
            <a name="ESD"></a>
Static electricity can interact with the environment to create an <b>electrostatic discharge</b>

<p>
            <a name="internal EM energy"></a>
A vehicle can also generate <b>internal sources of EM energy</b>, which by way of proximity can interfere with objects in the environment.
<p>
        <a name="induced EM"></a>
