<p>Many common environmental models share the same underlying stochastic pattern. In general, this means that we can use similar math to capture the characteristics of behavior across a range of domains even though the measured quantities are not comparable.

The important case for PCC estimates is the probability density function (PDF) of environmental characteristics showing a spread in uncertainty in values.
