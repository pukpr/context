<p>The fine terrain profiles can be modeled effectively by Markov and semi-Markov processes.

 <p>Both CSIR data and a model fit will be plotted.
<br>
For a profile, the model is Monte Carlo generated.
<br>
For a PSD, the model includes:
<ul>
<li>a semi-Markov stochastic representation
<li>a windowed FFT of the Monte Carlo profile.
</ul>

<p>The FFT can show quite a bit of noise, so use the moving average filter to reduce the noisy values so that the underlying spectrum is clearly delineated.
